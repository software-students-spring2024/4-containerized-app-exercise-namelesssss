# ** STRUCUTRE **
# def test_namey_name():
#   do something
#   more something
# assert THING == THING2
# repeat assert things until every part of that portion is tested

# just test like every function idk... - hannah

#grammar py:

# def check_grammar(passage)
# return passage, corrected_text, error_analysis, output

# def extract_data
# return corrected_text, error_summary

# def analyze_errors
# return error_analysis


# i'd say, i should just call these directly?? i think??
# but also idk fully for sure... i need to see this once we get the app running again


# testing the db.py

# honeslty db.py might be the focus for this??? since web app tests the other functionality?
# idk

# def store results
# adds results to the database
# stores: original_passage, fixed_passage, error_analysis, api_response)
# i think i wanna make sure it stores correctly by checking each individually ??? idk
